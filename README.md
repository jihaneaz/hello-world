# hello-world

Hello! My name is Jihane, and I am completing my MSc in Data Science, Technology & Innovation at the University of Edinburgh. I also have a BSc in Chemistry.

I am in the continuous process of improving my skills as a programmer and aspiring data scientist by becoming better at Python, SQL, and MongoDB and learning R, Git (hence this post), Tableau, and more. I have been doing this either via work experience, university courses, Zed Shaw's material (which I highly recommend), or online courses on Lynda.com.

If you are reading this, then I have completed the intro tutorial to GitHub.

If you are a recruiter, please say hello - I am currently on the job market!
